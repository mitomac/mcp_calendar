description: A tool for querying Duke University calendar events using natural language.
version: 1.0.0
license: MIT
required_open_webui_version: 0.4.0
requirements: requests

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS FOR LLM:
This tool helps you find and present events from Duke University's calendar based on natural language queries.

FOLLOW THESE EXACT STEPS WHEN ANSWERING CALENDAR QUERIES:
1. CONVERT TIME TO DATES: Use parse_date_range() to convert expressions like "today", "this weekend" into ISO format dates.
   Example: parse_date_range("this weekend") â†’ {"start_date": "2025-04-05", "end_date": "2025-04-06"}

2. GET SIMPLIFIED EVENTS: Use get_simplified_events() with the date range to retrieve events.
   Each event will have a local_id and essential details (title, categories, etc.)

3. ANALYZE & SELECT EVENTS: Examine the simplified events to find matches for the query.
   Look at titles, descriptions, categories, and groups (sponsors) to find relevant events.

4. GATHER ALL RELEVANT IDs: Collect all relevant local_ids into a SINGLE comma-separated list.
   IMPORTANT: Always batch multiple IDs into ONE call rather than making separate calls for each ID.
   Example: "9,12,13" NOT separate calls for 9, then 12, then 13.

5. GET FULL DETAILS IN ONE CALL: Use get_events_by_local_ids() with your comma-separated list.
   Example: get_events_by_local_ids("9,12,13")

6. PRESENT RESULTS APPROPRIATELY:
   - For a small number of events (1-5): Present each one with formatted details
   - For many events: Group by day or category, highlight 3-5 standout events, and offer filtering suggestions
   - For specific queries (e.g., "piano concerts"): Focus on the most relevant matches
   - Always present events chronologically when possible

HANDLING LARGE RESULT SETS:
If a query would return many events (e.g., "what's happening this week"):
1. Categorize and summarize (e.g., "15 arts events, 8 lectures...")
2. Highlight a few diverse, notable events
3. Group by day of the week
4. Offer to narrow the search ("Would you like to focus on weekend events?")
